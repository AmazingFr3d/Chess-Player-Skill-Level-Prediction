The approach integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. The study employs Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and a hybrid ensemble model to determine the most effective classification strategy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset Description\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-25T14:14:25.414954Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-25T14:14:25.415255Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-25T14:14:27.769732Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-25T14:14:25.415229Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-25T14:14:27.768634Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/kaggle/input/chess-games-dataset-lichess-2017-may/games_metadata_profile.csv\n/kaggle/input/chess-games-dataset-lichess-2017-may/games_metadata_profile_2024_01.csv\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Pre-processing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Engineering","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Handling Class Imbalance","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Training and Evaluation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Misclassification and Bias Analysis","metadata":{}}]}
